## Description

The MERN Book Search Engine is a web application that allows avid readers to search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase. It provides a user-friendly interface powered by a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application leverages the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

With the MERN Book Search Engine, users can perform book searches using keywords and view search results with details such as book titles, authors, descriptions, images, and links to the corresponding book on the Google Books site. Users can also create an account, log in, and save books to their personal account. The saved books are stored securely and can be accessed anytime. Additionally, users can view their saved books, remove books from their saved list, and log out when finished.

The MERN Book Search Engine combines the power of GraphQL, React, and MongoDB to deliver a seamless and personalized book searching and saving experience for users.
